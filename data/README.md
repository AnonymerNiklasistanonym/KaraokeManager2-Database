# Content of directory `data`

This directory contains any data/information that is not necessarily code.
Any concrete data should be inside this directory and never inline with the code!

Reasons to be excluded from the source code:

- Less code and only *real* code in `.js` files
  - code is more readable
  - code is much more maintainable
- If some data needs to be changed no code has to be changed
